###  Set up
yarn install to install dependencies

If you don't have yarn installed locally,
please refer to this documentation (https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

After yarn install, run yarn start, this will open the application on
http://localhost:5000

###  Notes
The app uses React as front end framework. There are 2 main components,
a stateful one app.js and a stateless one form.js.

### What would I have done better.

I think the solution around the calculateValue method in app.js, it is a good
working solution, but definitely there are better approach. If I had more time
I'd have done more research, and try to come up with a better optimized,
and scalable solution as the actual one it is very much tailored
for this project.

Also I'd have organized my sass even in a more modular way, like having
a button.scss, and a result.scss to further breakdown the app style.
